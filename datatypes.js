// comment are the un-executable information or the statement that javascript dont executes
// there are two types of comments in javascript:
// 1. single line ( // ) and 2. multiline comments ( /**/ )

/*

datatypes are the types of data
1. number -> used to store the numbers
2. string -> used to store the strings, represent or indicate by (" ") or ('')
3. undefined -> it means that the value is not defined , example variable is declared but not defined with value (let variableName; )
4. null -> null is a standalone value and it is not similar to undefined and is a object
5. boolean -> it represent two value either it would be true or false.
6. symbols -> basically it is majorly used in react for identifying every component's uniqueness.
7. object

// typeof is used to identify the type of the variable and can be use in two types:
console.log(typeof "viplove") // returns string as type here
console.log(typeof 67) // returns number as type here
                //or
console.log(typeof("viplove")) // this will also return the type of the variable as string

// but here when we check the type of the null , js will give this as object type, as per the js standards
console.log(typeof undefined) // its type = undefined only
